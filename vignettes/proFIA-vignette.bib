	calls for collaborative infrastructures where the large volume of
	new algorithms for data pre-processing, statistical analysis and
	annotation can be readily integrated whatever the language, evaluated
	on reference datasets and chained to build ad hoc workflows for users.
	We have developed Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M), the first fully open-source
	and collaborative online platform for computational metabolomics.
	W4M is a virtual research environment built upon the Galaxy web-based
	platform technology. It enables ergonomic integration, exchange and
	running of individual modules and workflows. Alternatively, the whole
	W4M framework and computational tools can be downloaded as a virtual
	machine for local installation.Availability and implementation: http://workflow4metabolomics.org
	homepage enables users to open a private account and access the infrastructure.W4M
	is developed and maintained by the French Bioinformatics Institute
	(IFB) and the French Metabolomics and Fluxomics Infrastructure (MetaboHUB).Contact:
	contact@workflow4metabolomics.org},
